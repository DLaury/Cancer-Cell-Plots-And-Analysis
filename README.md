# Cancer-Cell-Plots-And-Analysis
This project takes data on multiple drugs used to treat squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in mice. Two .csv files are imported into a jupyter notebook and then merged into one datafram utilizing the Python library Pandas. information is then extracted from the dataframes to analyze four specific treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo). Four graphs were produced and output to .jpeg files in the graphs folder. These graphs are:
    - A scatter plot showing tumor volume change over time of treatment
    - A scatter plot that shows number of metastatic site changes over time of treatment
    - A scatter plot of the number of mice alive over the course of treatment (survival rate)
    - A bar graph comparing percent tumor volume change for each drug  
Each of these graphs was created using the Matplotlib Python library.
